Forker 1.3 - TBC

Bug Fixes
	o setProcname a.k.a prctl is not available on OSX so don't try and call it.
    o setProcname throws UnsupportedOperationException breaking cross-platform compatibility.
    o ForkerWrapper main should capture any exception and log.
    o Ensure all sockets are connected on 127.0.0.1 loopback as previous use of getLocalHost appears inconsistent and caused execution failures.
