-----------------
    
Forker 1.1 - Privilege escalation

      sudo. Privilege escalation front end for systems that don't expose one (OS X)
    o Better PTY support using Pty4J.
    o Expanded utilities.

-----------------

Forker 1.2 - Wrapper

-----------------

Forker 1.3 - TBC

Bug Fixes
	o setProcname a.k.a prctl is not available on OSX so don't try and call it.
    o setProcname throws UnsupportedOperationException breaking cross-platform compatibility.
    o ForkerWrapper main should capture any exception and log.
    o Ensure all sockets are connected on 127.0.0.1 loopback as previous use of getLocalHost appears inconsistent and caused execution failures.
    o Privilege escalation left 'sapaXXXXX.sh' scripts in /tmp everytime sudo/su/gksudo/gksu 
      might be used until the JVM exits. These could fill /tmp entirely on long running systems.
